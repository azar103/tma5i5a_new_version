Place prepared taters in oil and cook about 5 minutes. They will have that blond-tone color to them. \n\n -- Note: Once you add cold potatoes to the hot oil, the temperature of your oil is going to drop - you want it to be somewhere between 330 - 325 degrees F. \n\n -- Remove from oil; drain and cool. Now - either refrigerate until ready to finish cooking, or cool completely and freeze up to 3 months. To freeze properly - place completely cooled fries in single layer on tray and place in freezer until frozen. Then bag them.\n\n -- To finish cooking - preheat your oil to 400* F. Add your cold fries (which will drop the oil temp - which is fine because you want it near the 375 degrees F. temp) and cook a few minutes until done. Lightly salt them and shake well so that the salt distributes well and they are not salty.',

Cover bowl with plastic and let dough proof at room temperature while pan and oven heat up.\n\n -- Meanwhile, cook hot sauce, marinara sauce, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Stir in cream, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and warmed through, about 10 minutes. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chicken, toss to coat, then add ¼ cup Buffalo sauce.\n\n -- Cook chicken, tossing occasionally, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until chicken is well coated and sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, lemon juice, celery salt, garlic powder, ¼ cup blue cheese, ½ tsp. pepper, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, adding more water if sauce seems too thick (it should be pourable); set aside.\n\n -- Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape with your hands into a round that’s slightly larger than the cast-iron skillet you’re using. Take hot skillet out of oven (watch that handle!) and place on a heatproof surface. Add a little flour to pan. Lay dough in skillet, then work edges of dough up sides of skillet with your fingertips (use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon if you’re nervous about touching the hot pan). Drizzle a little oil around inside edge of pan so that it trickles behind and underneath dough, which will encourage browning and help it release.\n\n -- Spread about ⅓ cup Buffalo sauce over dough. Arrange mozzarella over, then top with remaining ¼ cup blue cheese. Arrange chicken mixture on top. Bake pizza on top rack until crust and cheese are nicely browned, 15–20 minutes. Transfer skillet to stovetop (again, watch that handle!) and let pizza rest a few minutes. Using a spatula, slide pizza onto a cutting board or platter. Arrange celery over, then top with reserved blue cheese dressing. Season with pepper, then drizzle with oil.',
